Food delivery and review system schema design

Solution: 
When designing a schema for a food delivery and review system, there are several entities and relationships to consider. Here is a suggested schema design:

1. User Entity:
   - User ID (Primary Key)

   - Email
   - Password
   - Phone number
   - Address

2. Restaurant Entity:
   - Restaurant ID (Primary Key)

   - Address
   - Phone number
   - Cuisine type

3. Food Item Entity:
   - Item ID (Primary Key)
   - Restaurant ID (Foreign Key)
   - Name
   - Description
   - Price

4. Order Entity:
   - Order ID (Primary Key)

   - User ID (Foreign Key)
   - Restaurant ID (Foreign Key)

With this schema, you can establish the following relationships:

- A user can have multiple orders and reviews, and each order and review is associated with a specific user.
- A restaurant can have multiple food items, orders, and reviews, and each food item, order, and review is associated with a specific restaurant.
- An order can have multiple food items, and each food item can be part of multiple orders.
